== PROJECT: HR+

---

== Overview

HR+ is a recruiting and talent management desktop application targeting University Talent Acquisition Specialists. It is built to help them manage a significant number of student contacts and find the best-fitting candidates. University Talent Acquisition Specialists interact with HR+ using a Command Line Interface(CLI). HR+ has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX and it is written in Java with approximately kLOC.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *commands for users to manage ratings of a student after an interview*
** What it does: The `rate` command allows the user to evaluate a student's performance after an interview by assigning rating scores based on technical skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills and experience. It can also be used to edit the ratings of a student. The `rating-delete` command enables the user to delete the ratings assigned to a student.
** Justification: This feature is critical as it helps University Talent Acquisition Specialists track students' performance in interviews and decide whether or not to hire them.
** Highlights: This enhancement involves adding new commands to HR+. It requires a thorough understanding of the `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components and thus is challenging to implement.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `sort` command that allows the user to sort the current list of students in HR+ based on GPA, name or overall rating score in either ascending or descending order.
