== Introduction

HR+ is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, HR+ is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HR+ can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `HR.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for HR+.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
